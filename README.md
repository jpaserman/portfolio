## Projects

### Dimensionality Reduction in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data
This capstone project was completed in collaboration with the Wellcome Sanger Institute at the University of Cambridge as part of my M.Sc. in Data Science. Due to confidentiality agreements, I am unable to share the full code repository. The project focused on applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for dimensionality reduction in single-cell RNA sequencing data. My work involved developing novel approaches to handle high-dimensional biological data, implementing advanced computational methods in Python, and creating visualization tools to interpret complex genomic patterns. Through this project, I gained deep expertise in bioinformatics applications of machine learning, working with cutting-edge research institutions, and translating complex biological questions into computational solutions.

### Change Our View: A Distributed Topic Modelling Study of Persuasion Dynamics in r/ChangeMyView
[Research Report]() | [GitHub Repo]()  

This research explored persuasion dynamics in the r/ChangeMyView subreddit using distributed computing and natural language processing techniques. I built scalable data pipelines in PySpark to process large-scale Reddit discussion data and implemented distributed topic modeling algorithms to identify patterns in successful persuasion attempts. By analyzing millions of comments, I investigated the linguistic and structural features that make arguments more persuasive in online discourse. The project gave me practical experience in working with distributed computing frameworks, large-scale text analysis, and applying machine learning to understand human communication patterns.

### Locating Bacterial Flagellar Motors in 3D Tomogram Data
[Research Report]() | [GitHub Repo]()  

This project addressed the challenge of automatically detecting and localizing bacterial flagellar motors in three-dimensional cryo-electron tomogram data. Working with noisy, low-contrast 3D imaging data, I developed and compared multiple approaches ranging from custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to state-of-the-art object detection models. The project began with a custom PyTorch CNN for direct coordinate regression, and later expanded to include evaluations of YOLO variants (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) and RT-DETR models. I designed a preprocessing pipeline that extracted 2D slices from 3D tomograms with percentile-based normalization, implemented data augmentation strategies to account for orientation variation and occlusion, and performed systematic performance comparisons using mean Euclidean distance and F-2 scores. RT-DETR ultimately performed best, achieving a 22.54-pixel Euclidean distance error and a 0.926 F-2 score. This work provided valuable insights into the application of modern computer vision techniques to challenging biological imaging problems, particularly in contexts with low signal-to-noise ratios and small object detection requirements.

### Evaluating Classical Artificial Intelligence Algorithms on Standard and Variant Forms of Connect Four
[Research Report]() | [GitHub Repo]()  

This project involved implementing and comparing three classical AI algorithms for Connect Four: Monte Carlo Tree Search, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Alpha-Beta Pruning with a heuristic evaluation function. After hyperparameter tuning on the standard 7x6 board, I conducted tournaments under variant rule sets, including larger and smaller boards, a three-player setup, and the use of blocker stones. These modifications enabled a deeper evaluation of how each algorithm balanced win rate and computational efficiency in increasingly complex environments. Results showed that while Monte Carlo Tree Search performed strongly under large branching factors, Alpha-Beta with heuristic evaluation was the most consistent and adaptable across different conditions. This work provided hands-on experience with game-tree search algorithms, the design of controlled experiments for AI evaluation, and the study of trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in decision-making systems.

## Work Experience

### AIVF — Tel Aviv, Israel  
**Data Analyst / Data Engineer | September 2022 – September 2024**  

At AIVF, a startup dedicated to advancing AI-powered IVF solutions, I developed analytical solutions to improve both patient outcomes and clinical operations. I conducted statistical analysis in Python to assess proprietary algorithms designed to improve pregnancy outcomes, leading the statistical evaluation that demonstrated embryos in the top predicted tier had pregnancy success rates exceeding 50%—a critical validation of the model’s clinical impact. Additionally, I built an automated data pipeline using Python and AWS that migrated Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from IVF clinics into standardized formats and databases. This automation directly enabled the recruitment of five international clinic clients by significantly improving operational efficiency. Through this role, I gained extensive experience in healthcare data engineering, statistical validation of machine learning models in clinical settings, and building scalable cloud-based infrastructure.

### Federal Reserve Bank of Boston — Boston, USA  
**Research Intern for Principal Economist and Policy Advisor | May 2021 – May 2022**  

At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, I supported research on financial economics, monetary policy, and international trade. My work included extensive data collection and cleaning, the development of econometric models, and the creation of visualizations in Stata to support peer-reviewed publications. I collaborated on three major research projects focusing on multinational mergers and acquisitions, global banking shocks, and commercial real estate lending. This experience provided rigorous training in applied economic research methods, working with large and complex financial datasets, and contributing to policy-relevant analysis within a major financial institution.
