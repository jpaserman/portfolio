## üìÇ Projects


### Dimensionality Reduction in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data
Capstone project with the Wellcome Sanger Institute, University of Cambridge. Applied machine learning techniques for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing data. Developed computational methods in Python and visualization tools to interpret genomic patterns, gaining expertise in bioinformatics and translating biological questions into computational solutions.

### Change Our View: A Distributed Topic Modelling Study of Persuasion Dynamics in r/ChangeMyView
[Research Report]() | [GitHub Repo]()  

Analyzed persuasion dynamics in the r/ChangeMyView subreddit using distributed computing and natural language processing. Built scalable data pipelines in PySpark, applied distributed topic modeling, and studied linguistic features linked to successful persuasion. This work developed expertise in large-scale text analysis and distributed machine learning.

### Locating Bacterial Flagellar Motors in 3D Tomogram Data
[Research Report]() | [GitHub Repo]()  

Developed computer vision approaches to detect bacterial flagellar motors in noisy 3D cryo-electron tomograms. Implemented preprocessing, data augmentation, and evaluated models including custom CNNs, YOLO variants, and RT-DETR. RT-DETR achieved the best results with a 22.54-pixel error and 0.926 F-2 score, highlighting its strength in small object detection within challenging biological data.

### Evaluating Classical Artificial Intelligence Algorithms on Connect Four
[Research Report]() | [GitHub Repo]()  

Implemented and compared Monte Carlo Tree Search, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and heuristic Alpha-Beta for Connect Four. Tested algorithms on rule variations including different board sizes, three-player setups, and blocker stones. Found Alpha-Beta with heuristic evaluation to be the most consistent and adaptable across environments, while MCTS excelled with larger branching factors.

## Work Experience

### AIVF ‚Äî Tel Aviv, Israel  
**Data Analyst / Data Engineer | September 2022 ‚Äì September 2024**  

At AIVF, a startup dedicated to advancing AI-powered IVF solutions, I developed analytical solutions to improve both patient outcomes and clinical operations. I conducted statistical analysis in Python to assess proprietary algorithms designed to improve pregnancy outcomes, leading the statistical evaluation that demonstrated embryos in the top predicted tier had pregnancy success rates exceeding 50%‚Äîa critical validation of the model‚Äôs clinical impact. Additionally, I built an automated data pipeline using Python and AWS that migrated Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from IVF clinics into standardized formats and databases. This automation directly enabled the recruitment of five international clinic clients by significantly improving operational efficiency. Through this role, I gained extensive experience in healthcare data engineering, statistical validation of machine learning models in clinical settings, and building scalable cloud-based infrastructure.

### Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ‚Äî Boston, USA  
**Research Intern for Principal Economist and Policy Advisor | May 2021 ‚Äì May 2022**  

At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, I supported research on financial economics, monetary policy, and international trade. My work included extensive data collection and cleaning, the development of econometric models, and the creation of visualizations in Stata to support peer-reviewed publications. I collaborated on three major research projects focusing on multinational mergers and acquisitions, global banking shocks, and commercial real estate lending. This experience provided rigorous training in applied economic research methods, working with large and complex financial datasets, and contributing to policy-relevant analysis within a major financial institution.
